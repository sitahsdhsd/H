## What Exactly Are ERM and ORM?

Let's break it down. **ERM** is a visual way to design databases, using diagrams to show entities (like customers or products) and their relationships. Think of it as the blueprint. **ORM**, on the other hand, is a programming technique that lets you interact with databases using objects. It translates between your code and the database, saving you from writing complex SQL queries.

## Key Differences:

*   **Focus:** ERM focuses on database design; ORM focuses on data access within applications.
*   **Tools:** ERM uses diagrams; ORM uses code libraries or frameworks (e.g., Hibernate, Entity Framework).
*   **Purpose:** ERM helps plan the database structure; ORM simplifies database interaction for developers.

This **free course** helps you understand these concepts thoroughly and apply them in real-world scenarios.
